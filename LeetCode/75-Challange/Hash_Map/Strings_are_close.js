// Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

// Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
// For example, abcde -> aecdb
// Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
// For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
