3. Practice Platforms
Leetcode: Practice coding problems topic-wise. There are also many curated lists of interview problems.
HackerRank: Offers a range of DSA challenges with varying difficulty.
Codeforces/CodeChef: Focus on timed contests that challenge your problem-solving skills under pressure.
GeeksforGeeks: Great for topic-wise problems and solutions with in-depth explanations.
4. Mock Interviews and Competitions
Participate in coding contests (Codeforces, LeetCode Weekly Contests).
Conduct mock interviews on platforms like Pramp or InterviewBit.
Time yourself when solving problems to simulate the interview environment.
5. Additional Tips
Practice consistently. Set a goal to solve at least 2-3 problems a day.
Revise regularly by revisiting previously solved problems.
Track your progress to identify your weak areas and work on them.
Focus on optimization—start with brute force, then refine your solutions to improve time and space complexity.
