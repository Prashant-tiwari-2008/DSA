Here’s a list of important string algorithms to prepare for big companies, along with brief explanations of each:
1. Brute Force String Matching
    Description: A simple approach to find all occurrences of a pattern in a text. You check each position in the text to see if the substring starting there matches the pattern.
    Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
    Usage: This method is easy to implement but inefficient for large inputs.
2. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
    Description: An efficient string-matching algorithm that preprocesses the pattern to avoid unnecessary comparisons. It builds a Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array that helps to skip unnecessary matches.
    Time Complexity: O(n + m)
    Advantages: Avoids redundant comparisons by using the LPS array.
    Usage: Commonly used for pattern searching in a large text.
3. Rabin-Karp Algorithm
    Description: This algorithm uses hashing to quickly find if a pattern matches a substring in a text. It compares the hash of the pattern with the hash of substrings of the text.
    Time Complexity: O(n + m) on average, O(n * m) worst case.
    Advantages: Efficient when searching for multiple patterns.
    Usage: Useful for detecting plagiarism or multiple pattern searches.
4. Z Algorithm
    Description: Finds all occurrences of a pattern in a text in linear time. It constructs a Z-array, which stores the length of the longest substring starting from i that matches a prefix of the text.
    Time Complexity: O(n + m)
    Advantages: Simple and efficient for finding a pattern in a text or performing substring searches.
    Usage: Useful in problems involving substring searches and finding repeating patterns.
5. Boyer-Moore Algorithm
    Description: A right-to-left string matching algorithm. It preprocesses the pattern to create two arrays, Bad Character and Good Suffix, which help skip sections of the text that can't possibly match the pattern.
    Time Complexity: O(n / m) best case, O(n * m) worst case.
    Advantages: Efficient when the pattern is large compared to the alphabet.
    Usage: Often used for searching long patterns in large texts, as it skips more characters than KMP.
6. Aho-Corasick Algorithm (Trie + Automaton)
    Description: Used to search for multiple patterns in a text simultaneously. It builds a Trie of the patterns and converts it into a finite state machine to perform searches efficiently.
    Time Complexity: O(n + m + k) where k is the number of matches found.
    Advantages: Fast for multiple pattern searching.
    Usage: Ideal for searching multiple patterns (like in dictionary lookups or bioinformatics).
7. Suffix Arrays & LCP Array
    Suffix Array:
    Description: A sorted array of all suffixes of a given string. Useful for pattern matching, finding the longest common prefix (LCP), or solving problems like longest repeated substring.
    Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    LCP Array:
    Description: LCP stands for Longest Common Prefix, and the LCP array stores the lengths of the longest common prefixes between consecutive suffixes in the suffix array.
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Usage: Efficient for range queries, longest repeated substring, and other suffix-related problems.
8. Suffix Trees
    Description: A compressed trie of all the suffixes of a given string. It allows for efficient pattern matching, finding the longest common substring, and string comparison.
    Time Complexity: O(n) for construction and O(m) for pattern matching.
    Advantages: More space-efficient than a suffix array.
    Usage: Used in applications like DNA sequencing and substring searches.
9. Manacher's Algorithm (for Longest Palindromic Substring)
    Description: A linear-time algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Advantages: Very efficient, transforming the string to avoid the complexities of odd/even palindromes.
    Usage: Particularly useful for finding palindromes in DNA sequences, texts, etc.
10. Rolling Hash
    Description: A hashing technique that allows you to compute the hash of a substring in constant time after computing the hash for the initial substring.
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Advantages: Efficient for substring searches where you need to compare hashes instead of entire substrings.
    Usage: Used in string matching algorithms like Rabin-Karp and in detecting anagrams or plagiarism.
11. Trie (Prefix Tree)
    Description: A tree-like data structure where each node represents a single character of a string. It’s used for storing and searching strings efficiently.
    Time Complexity: O(L) for insert and search where L is the length of the string.
    Advantages: Very fast lookup, often used in autocomplete and dictionary problems.
    Usage: Useful for string matching, prefix search, and implementing dictionaries.
12. Levenshtein Distance (Edit Distance)
    Description: A dynamic programming algorithm to find the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to convert one string into another.
    Time Complexity: O(n * m)
    Advantages: Widely used in spell-checking, DNA sequence analysis, and fuzzy string matching.
    Usage: Useful for spelling corrections, sequence alignment, and natural language processing.
13. Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)
    Description: A text transformation that improves the efficiency of compression algorithms. The output of the transform is easier to compress, used in Bzip2.
    Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    Usage: Mainly used in data compression techniques and suffix array construction.
14. Longest Common Substring / Subsequence
    Longest Common Substring:
    Description: A dynamic programming solution to find the longest substring that two given strings share.
    Time Complexity: O(n * m)
    Longest Common Subsequence:
    Description: Similar to the substring problem but allows for non-contiguous matches (characters can be skipped).
    Time Complexity: O(n * m)
    Usage: Common in DNA sequence alignment, version control systems (to detect diffs), and in document comparison.
15. Anagram Search / Check
    Description: This involves finding whether two strings are anagrams of each other, or finding all anagrams of a given pattern in a string.
    Approach:
    Sort both strings and compare.
    Use hashing to count character frequencies and compare counts.
    Time Complexity: O(n) using a frequency count method.
    Usage: Used in pattern matching, language processing, and dictionary lookups.
